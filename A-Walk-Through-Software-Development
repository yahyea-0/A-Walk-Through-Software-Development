                        Our IBM Skill Build experience has been an engaging and eye opening one. Throughout the course of the program, we learned the various dimensions of software development, from learning the fundamentals of coding to applying the skills we learned on projects. We used interactive modules that instructed us in coding languages, web development, and the problem-solving skills used by real-life developers. The most rewarding experience has been doing tasks on real projects that challenged us to develop functional programs and the software developer mindset. The program not only equipped us with the technical skills but also gave us the confidence to become career technologists. IBM Skill Build as a whole, provided us with the platform on which we learned to develop as learners, creators, and future developers. Initially we started with minimal familiarity with software, but lesson by lesson and project by project we built a good understanding of the behind-the-scenes of software development. Each of the modules motivated us to get into the mindset of thinking differently, solving problems creatively and acquiring genuine coding skills. Throughout the process of doing these projects with each other, we learned the importance of planning and communication when developing software. Challenges we overcame increased our self-confidence and prepared us for what lies ahead in the world of tech. IBM Skill Build taught us more than coding — we learned how to develop as individuals and as developers.

                        <p>As part of our course learning on IBM Skill Build, we began by learning the basics of programming that gave us the foundation we needed in order to learn how software works. We contimued with basic things like variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions. These enabled us to write basic programs and understand how the computer interprets instructions.</p>

                            <li>Variables and data types – How to store and manage information</li>

                            <li>Functions – organizing code into reusable blocks</li>

                        <p>During our IBM Skill Build experience, we learned the basics of web development and the way websites get built and work. We started with front-end web development and how to structure and build websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We learned how to make websites responsive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. We learned how to organize files, connect pages between them, and handle content. This helped us code a website from the ground up and laid the groundwork for learning more complex web development.</p>

                        <p>As we progressed in the IBM Skill Build program, we explored the fundamentals of backend development — the part of web development that runs behind the scenes. While the frontend focuses on what users see and interact with, the backend handles all the logic, data, and server-side processes that power those features. We learned how websites connect to databases, manage user input, and deliver information securely and efficiently. By working with tools like Node.js and learning about APIs, we started to understand how full-stack development works. It gave us a deeper appreciation for how websites function beyond the surface.</p>

It opened our eyes to the realization that we should create secure and reliable software.</p>

Throughout our IBM Skill Build timeline, we also focused on team collaboration — a key part of working in tech. We learned how to communicate clearly, divide tasks, and work together to solve problems and complete projects efficiently. Collaboration helped us build better results and grow our collaboration skills.

                            One of the projects that we completed in IBM Skill Build is “Build Your Own Movie Recommender with Django.” In the project, we constructed a fundamental web application that offers personalized movie recommendations based on user input. Using Django as a web framework for the Python coding language, the project aimed at giving us practical experience in building a functional website that accepts input from the user, interacts with a database, and offers personalized movie suggestions. The concept behind the project was that we should apply what we had learned in practice by implementing backend development, user interface, and general machine learning logic in an entertaining way.

These were no textbook lessons; these were real-life dilemmas that set us up as better developers and problem solvers. We learned how to code on purpose, how to work together as a team properly, and how to properly debug the software we've built. But most of all, perhaps, we learned how the different aspects of tech - development, security, and AI - overlap and enhance each other in the real world.</p>
